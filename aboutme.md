subtitle: And how I spend my time
---

My name is Brett Dickinson. Besides time with friends and family and cats, my favorite pastimes are:
- Watching sports - I love the LA Dogers, AZ Cardinals, and LA Kings
- Reading good books
- Learning new things
- Drinking Coffee
- Traveling
- Dreaming about fixing up my old bike

### My story

Despite what my wife might tell you, I don't ONLY watch, talk about, play, or think about sports. These days most of my time has been spent enjoying life with our first baby!

In 2018, I graduated with a degree in accounting but had a strong feeling that accounting was not for me. I had more passion for data and analytics - so I spent my time searching for analytics (what I wanted) or finance (what I had experience in) jobs. I ended up starting my career as a financial analyst in the healthcare industry. Fast-forward 4+ years and I found myself working with data enough to scratch the itch, but also feeling like I was selling myself short of my passions.

I decided 2023 would be a year of change and I started pushing myself to learn more and look for new work opportunities. I ended up landing a data analytics role at a company that allowed me space to take on more data-heavy enginnering work. So now I continue to look for new cool things to learn and ways to upskill and scratch each new exciting itch that pops up :). 

It would be great to learn more about you too! Feel free to reach out on any of the links below if you would like to connect!
